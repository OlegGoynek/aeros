  <h2>Interactive order form.</h2>
  <h3>1. Introduction.</h3>
  Now you may forget all these Paints and Paintbrushes as well as Photoshops and other graphic and/or PDF editors.<br>
  Armed with an interactive order form and PDF-printer you can create ready-to-send order forms by means of a few mouse-clicks and a few typed words.<br>
  
  <h3>2. Compatibility issues.</h3>
  <b>Please note</b>: these forms are fully compatible with the following web-browsers - 
  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all.html" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a>,
  <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/ru/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>,
  <a href="http://support.apple.com/downloads/#internet" target="_blank">Apple Safari</a> and
  <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/" target="_blank">Opera... Opera</a>.<br><br>
  Microsoft Internet Explorer (default web-browser for Windows) can't render SVG graphics, so it won't work. At least, it's true for Windows versions prior Windows 8.
  
  <h3>3. Note about colors match.</h3>
  <b>Please keep in mind</b>: colors that are shown on your display are not exact.
  At least, they differ from colors of other office monitors.<br>
  So we can't guarantee the real wing colors will look exactly as displayed.
  But the ordered colors will match the real ones as close as possible.
  
  <h3>4. Sending an order to Aeros.</h3>
  There are two ways to create an order form:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>After choosing colors and options you can fill the old form in using the info from these interactive forms and send it to us.
    In other words: these new forms act like helpers.</li>
    <li>You can create PDF-file that contains your order using one of many PDF-printers available in the WWW.
    All you need to do after "selecting, checking and filling in" is just "print" the order form with a PDF-printer.<br>
    We recommend this one: <a href="http://www.dopdf.com/" target="_blank"><b>doPDF - Free PDF Converter</b></a>.
    It's fully free, multilingual, easy to install and use.</li>
  </ol>
