      CONCERNING PLATFORM TOWING ONLY.<BR>
      We have done ground tests with the rope attachment at the nose junction 
      to the front bolt between the keel tube and the bottom nose plate(as it 
      has been suggested by Martin Henry in <A HREF=http://ozreport.com/9.213 TARGET=_blank>OZ 
      Report # 213</A>). With the slot made in the right place of the nose cone 
      it was impossible to get the rope or the nose cone to interfere with the 
      safety spring, the nose wire hook or the front wires.<BR>
      <BR>
      To determine the correct location for the slot in the nose cone we recommend 
      to rig the glider on the tow system (without the nose cone in place) , then 
      transfer the nose release line angle on to the nose cone. The 2 inch (50 
      millimeters) slot will allow for a reasonable amount of angle of attack 
      variation (see Martin Henry's suggestion in the <A HREF=http://ozreport.com/9.213 TARGET=_blank>OZ 
      Report # 213</A>).<BR>
      <BR>
      As a result of these tests we have reached conclusion that it is possible 
      to use the abovementioned method of the rope attachment for the gliders 
      used for platform towing without changing the front wires with the wires 
      catch assemblies.<BR>
      <BR>
      For those pilots who are still willing to perform the modification of their 
      gliders with the retrofit kit (see <A HREF=N6_e.htm>Safety Bulletin N 6</A>) 
      for the platform tow Aeros will provide the parts for modification as an 
      option. <BR>
