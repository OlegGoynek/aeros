<p align="center"><strong>Safety  Directive-016</strong><br />
    <strong>August  12, 2013</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Status:  Mandatory</strong></p>

<p><strong>Background</strong> </p>
<p>During the  last week we had information of two in-flight crossbeam accidents on our latest  Combat gliders. Fortunately, both pilots were unharmed.</p>
<p>The first  accident happened on August 2nd, and while the investigation was still  on the way, we received news about the similar accident that happened on August  8th.<br />
  Both  accidents happened during level flight at moderate speed and the weather more  or less calm (normal flight load).<br />
  Both crossbeams  broke in the same place and in a very similar pattern.<br />
  Both  gliders were not new and had between 40 and 60 flights, some of the flights in  far worse conditions.<br />
  Both crossbeams  that failed had passed the factory load test.</p>
<p>After a  thorough investigation made by the representatives of Aeros together with the  representatives of the crossbeam manufacturer, based on both accident  reports and a personal check of one of the gliders, the reason of this  structural failure has been discovered. In both cases it was caused by an  infrequent manufacturing defect that went undetected by our quality control  system. </p>
<p><strong>Scope</strong> </p>
<p>This Safety  Directive covers all Combat hang gliders with a carbon crossbeam manufactured  in 2011, 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance:</strong> </p>
<p>To avoid any further incidents, we strongly recommend to STOP FLYING all Aeros  Combat hang gliders manufactured between 2011 and 2013 until their crossbeams  are inspected by our authorized dealers. Please, contact an Aeros dealer  nearest to you for the carbon crossbeam inspection on your Combat hang glider.<br />
    <strong><br />
  </strong>All Aeros hang glider dealers will<strong> </strong>receive detailed instructions for the crossbeam  inspection and testing. These procedures will allow us to find any further  similar defects in the crossbeams and fully exclude similar failures on the  re-tested pieces.</p>
<p>The same additional  test procedures will immediately be implemented in our production process as  well.</p>
<p>In case of  any questions do not hesitate to contact Aeros at <a href="mailto:aerosint@aerosint.kiev.ua">aerosint@aerosint.kiev.ua</a> </p>
<p>COMPLIANCE  IS MANDATORY AND HAS TO BE ACHIEVED BEFORE THE NEXT FLIGHT!<br />
</p>
<p>Fly safe!</p>
