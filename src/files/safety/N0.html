      <p>NOTE! <font color="#FF0000">Your attention to peculiarities of the wings 
        with trilam leading edge</font>. By the way, this concerns not only Aeros 
        wings. Using a wing with trilam leading edge it is necessary to be careful 
        under rainfall and dew. Water droplets do not form a thin film on the 
        trilam surface, thus changing aerodynamics of the profile, which causes 
        change in the wing's performance. As a rule, in this case increase in 
        trim speed (by 5-15 km/h) and stall speed (by 5-10 km/h) is observed, 
        which means change in controllability. To avoid unpleasant surprise, we 
        recommend to wipe dew drops off the leading edge and before flying in 
        the rain to wipe the leading edge with shampoo or other detergent preventing 
        accumulation of drops on the surface. </p>
