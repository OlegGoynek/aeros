      <p><b>Dear Pilots</b>,</p>
      <p> We have become aware of a potential problem with the Aeros Target, Discus, 
        Stealth and Combat series gliders. The hex nut M8, # 11 350 (all the numbers 
        given here correspond to the numbers in the list in the Stealth KPL 3 
        / Combat manual) was loosened on the bolt that attaches the top of the 
        control frame to the keel tube - commonly referred to as the heart bolt 
        (part No. STL 245000), distorting the safety ring. We strongly recommend 
        you to replace this nut with the nylon lock nut M8, securing it with the 
        safety ring (replace the original safety ring, if necessary).</p>
      <p> This nut should be inspected and/or replaced on the gliders of the following 
        models:<br>
        All Target Series<br>
        All Discus Series<br>
        All Stealth Series<br>
        All Combat Series </p>
      <p>Pilots can either make this modification on their own, using two screw-drivers 
        (see the picture), or address your local dealer. </p>

      <p>We have also become aware of a remote, but still potential problem with 
        the safety ring that is used to secure the clevis pin that holds the rear 
        wires to the keel. The stock safety ring can too easily be removed. Therefore 
        for your safety we recommend to replace the original safety ring by the 
        2.5 turn safety ring or by a split (cotter) pin + washer.</p>
      <p> Fly safe!</p>
      <p> Yours, Team Aeros </p>
