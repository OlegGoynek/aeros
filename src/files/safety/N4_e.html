      <p>Recently, a customer experienced a failure of the main hang strap failure 
        on a Viper harness at the base where the main strap comes through the 
        backplate slot. The backup system that is integrated into the harness 
        did it's job and the pilot landed safely. We recommend all owners of the 
        Viper & Viper 2 harnesses to inspect thoroughly the base of the main hang 
        strap, especially the place where it comes through the carbon backplate 
        slot. There should be no wear caused by the main hang strap contact to 
        the edges of the carbon backplate. In case of wear or damage detection 
        on the main strap please contact your local representative of Aeros for 
        free strap replacement. </p>
      <p>The main strap damage evidently occured because of the axle misalignment 
        relative to the position of the slot on the plate. Most probably the above 
        case was an isolated incident, nevertheless we advise all Viper pilots 
        to inspect that place on the harness thorougly. </p>
      <p>If indeed, strap wear is detected, in addition to the replacement of 
        the main hang strap we recommend to increase the width of the slot in 
        the plate, filing each side by 2 - 2.5 mm. The total width of the slot 
        should increase from 25 to 29-30 mm. </p>
