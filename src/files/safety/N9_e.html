      <strong>To all Aeros' harness owners      </strong>
      <p>We are addressing this message to Aeros' distributors and   dealers, owners of Aeros' harness regardless of what type of harness they fly.   There was an accident in Germany on July 2009 with a pilot flying <strong>Aeros   Viper</strong> harness with separated leg loops. Due to the pilot’s report the leg loops   on the harness where positioned too low which enabled him sliding in the harness   down that much, that he was not able to get his feet inside the harness, went   into lockout and crashed. There was no proper harness hang check done by the   pilot prior the flight. To avoid further speculations about this fact we would   like to inform you as follows:</p>
    <ul><li>We have decided to stop the production of the Viper harnesses with   separated leg loops to prevent the possible ambiguity in future, as separated   leg loops may create more possibility for the pilot to slide in the harness down   when hanging in the upright position.</li>
    <li>We strongly recommend to all pilots regardless of what type of   harness they fly to provide a careful hang check in the upright position when   they make a first flight in a new to them harness to be able to except all   possibilities of sliding in the harness down during take off or   landing.</li></ul>
    <p>If you have concerns about your flying equipment, feel free   to ask your local dealer or an Aeros distributor for advice for more   professional assessment.</p>
    <p>Also, you may email us or our distributors and ask to   rebuild or to replace your flying equipment, if necessary.</span></p>
    <p>Wishing you safe and enjoyable   flights</p>
