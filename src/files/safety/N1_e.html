      <p> <b>Dear Friends</b>, </p>
      <p>We are addressing this message to Aeros' distributors and dealers, owners 
        of Aeros' trike wings and all trike pilots regardless of what wing they 
        fly. </p>
      <p>There was a catastrophic failure of a Stream 16 leading edge in the USA 
        on November 17, 2001. At this point, the exact cause is undetermined. 
      </p>
      <p>The wing was manufactured in September 1999.</p>
      <p> The manager of Aeros Ltd. Alexander Voronin, who in the past was a structural 
        engineer at the Antonov Design Bureau, visited the USA at the end of February 
        2002, attending EAA meeting and intending to inspect the wreckage. Unfortunately 
        he wasn't given an opportunity to do this.</p>
      <p> There is also a report that another Stream 16 wing was found with what 
        looks like a flaw in the leading edge, at or near the location of the 
        previous problem. We have no reasons to associate the flaw discovered 
        in this second wing with the leading edge failure of the first wing, simply 
        because we don't have enough information at the moment. </p>
      <p>However, being cautious - without alarm - is prudent.</p>
      <p> Any engineer knows that upon inspection, the fracture pattern will show 
        clearly and unambiguously if the reason of the failure was a crack. To 
        determine if this is the case, it is necessary to inspect the wreckage.</p>
      <p> When either we or our distributor in the US - Richard Helm of Sabre 
        Aircraft have such opportunity, we will inspect this wreckage. You can 
        rest assured that further information will be posted by Aeros on this 
        website and others. </p>
      <p>In the meantime, we would like to avoid speculation and stop rumors, 
        we would like to inform you as follows:</p>
      <p> Before 2000, the tubing used in the construction of Aeros trike wings 
        was anodized in a manner that left cosmetic flaws on the tubing. This 
        anodizing method has since been changed, but it is important that when 
        inspecting your wing, that you know the difference between a cosmetic 
        flaw and a flaw that affects the structural integrity of the aircraft. 
        We have posted a photo of a tube with a cosmetic flaw on our website. 
        Do not be alarmed if your 'pre - 2000' wing has this surface flaw. <a href="tube01.htm" target="_blank">Click 
        here</a></p>
      <p> If you have concerns about an area of question, feel free to send the 
        tube to your local dealer or an Aeros distributor for inspection. Also, 
        you may email us or our distributors any digital photo of an area of concern 
        for a more professional assessment.</p>
      <p> Feel free to contact either of the following for advice on your tubing:

      <p> We would like to point out that a problem of concern with our tubing 
        would be rare and we do not expect an ongoing problem. However it is important 
        to exercise caution until the exact cause of failure is determined. We 
        would like to remind you that wing checks should be performed on a regular 
        basis, this concerns not only checking the tubing, but other parts of 
        the wing as well.</p>
      <p> Section 4 of the Aeros Stranger/Stream trike wings manual reads as follows: 
      </p>
      <hr width="50%" noshade> <h5><font color="#0000FF">Section 4. INSPECTION 
        OF THE WING </font></h5>
      <p><font color="#0000FF">The sail should be inspected once every three months 
        or after each 50 flying hours. The frame should be inspected once a year, 
        after every 100 flying hours, and after every hard landing.</font></p>
      <h5><font color="#0000FF"> 4.1. SAIL CHECK-UP</font></h5>
      <p><font color="#0000FF"> 4.1.1. Sail seam and cloth strength are assessed 
        by testing the strength of the control clouts on the top surface (TS) 
        of the wing. The control clouts are incorporated in the cloth piece (designated 
        by letters UV) that is sewed onto the trailing edge close to the keel 
        tube. For sail assessment cut control clout in the drawing and forward 
        it to your Aeros dealer or directly to Aeros. The first sample is to be 
        cut out after 300 flying hours and thereafter a sample must be submitted 
        after every 150 flying hours.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF"> 4.1.2. Checking the sail surface and seams. There 
        should be no cuts, ruptures, threadbare holes and torn seams on the sail. 
        Any torn seams should be re-stitched. Cuts and ruptures on the fairing 
        and bottom surface (BS) of the sail that are not longer than 30 mm can 
        be patched up with self-adhesive Dacron. The Dacron must be of a weight 
        of not less than 100 g/m. Larger cuts and ruptures are to be repaired 
        by stitching on a reinforcing piece of the same fabric (stitched along 
        the edges). Any rupture shorter than 50 mm can be repaired in this manner, 
        but more complicated repairs should be carried out in the workshop of 
        producing company. If any of the batten tightening cords are torn or heavily 
        worn they must be replaced. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF">4.1.3. Keep an eye on the sail grommets/eyelets 
        and all areas of the sail that are subject to extra stress, especially 
        the keel section, the nose section of leading edge and the outer tip section 
        of leading edge. </font></p>
      <h5><font color="#0000FF">4.2. CABLE SYSTEM </font></h5>
      <p><font color="#0000FF">The cables must be checked for broken wires. If 
        any defect on a wire is observed, no matter how small, the cable in question 
        <b>MUST BE REPLACED</b>. It is recommended that the entire cable system 
        be replaced once every two years irrespective of service conditions. </font></p>
      <h5><font color="#0000FF">4.3. CHECKING THE TUBINGS</font></h5>
      <p><font color="#0000FF"> <u>To check the condition of the wing tubes the 
        sail should be removed from the wing frame and the tubes should be detached 
        at the joints. The tubes are to be inspected visually. When there is suspicion 
        of damage, the points in question should be inspected using a magnifying 
        glass of (5-10)X magnification. There should be no trace of corrosion, 
        cracks, bends or dents. </u></font></p>
      <h5><font color="#0000FF">4.4. CHECKING THE BATTENS</font></h5>
      <p><font color="#0000FF"> The batten profiles should be checked against 
        the template and the bends should be adjusted if necessary. Check all 
        the plastic batten heads and tails and replace if necessary. </font></p>
      <h5><font color="#0000FF">4.5. FASTENERS</font></h5>
      <p><font color="#0000FF"> Check all fasteners (bolts, screws, rollers, nuts, 
        splint pins etc.) for corrosion. Any corroded fasteners should be replaced. 
        Bolts should not be worn and/or bent. Key bolts should be checked most 
        thoroughly for cracks between the head and the bolt body. These are the 
        bolts at the control bar side and bottom joints, the central spreader 
        bar tensioning cable attach point and the rear cable attachment point 
        on the keel tube. If any cracks are observed - <b>REPLACE IMMEDIATELY</b>! 
        </font></p>
      <font color="#0000FF">&nbsp; </font> <hr width="50%" noshade> <p>Observing these 
        requirements you ensure your own safety and safety of your customers. 
        In view of the abovementioned we at Aeros address all our distributors, 
        dealers and customers to make a thorough check of your wings, especially 
        the tubing, paying most attention to the outer leading edge tube (leading 
        edge tube No. 3) before the next flight. If customers are unable to perform 
        checks themselves, this should be done by Aeros' dealers. Should any cracks 
        be discovered in the tubing in Aeros' wings, such tubes will be replaced 
        by Aeros free, including transportation, through the network of dealers. 
        In case a pilot finds abrasions on the tubes which occurred in the process 
        of normal use of the wing, the replacement tubing can be ordered through 
        the dealers' network. </p>
