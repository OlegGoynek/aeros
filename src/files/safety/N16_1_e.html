<p align="center"><strong>Extension of the Scope of the Safety Directive-016</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Carbon Crossbeam Check on Aeros Combat Hang Gliders  Produced in 2010 - 2013</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>August 16, 2013</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Based on the in-depth study of the problem we have  decided to extend the scope of the Safety Directive-016 dd. August 12, 2013 and  to arrange immediate re-testing of all the carbon crossbeams on Combat gliders  produced since January 2010 to date. Combat gliders produced between January  2007 and January 2010 are not within the scope of the Safety Directive-016.  However, Aeros recommends to check the crossbeam in the same manner at the next  detailed glider check-up according to the glider maintenance schedule.</p>
<p><strong>The  infrequent </strong>manufacturing defect referred to in the Safety  Directive-016 is displacement of a carbon fabric layer while the crossbeam  preform is compressed in the course of production process. This can result in a  weak line forming along the crossbeam wall. And this is exactly what happened  on both crossbeams that failed.</p>
<p><strong>After the  numerous factory tests Aeros has developed the method of revealing such  defects. Please, contact an Aeros dealer nearest to you to have the crossbeam  checked.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
<p>Hence, the scope of the Safety Directive-016 is  extended to cover all Combat hang gliders produced since January 2010 to date,  with the range starting from</p>
<p><strong>Combat 12,8</strong><br />
  - from serial # 031.10, sail # 4492, produced in April  2010<br />
- to serial # 062.12, sail # 5338, produced in December  2012</p>
<p><strong>Combat 12,4</strong><br />
  - from serial # 031.12, sail # 5158, produced in June  2012<br />
- to serial # 010.13, sail # 5469, produced in April  2013</p>
<p><strong>Combat 13,2</strong><br />
  - from serial # 095.09, sail # 4397, produced in  January 2010<br />
- to serial # 015.13, sail # 5444, produced in April  2013</p>
<p><strong>Combat 13,7</strong><br />
  - from serial # 008.10, sail # 4434, produced in April  2010<br />

<p><strong>Combat 13,5</strong><br />
  - from serial # 063.10, sail # 4625, produced in 2010<br />
- to serial # 024.13, sail # 5508, produced in July  2013</p>
<p><strong>Combat 14,2</strong><br />
  - from serial # 099.09, sail # 4405, produced in February  2010<br />
- to serial # 026.13, sail # 5518, produced in July  2013.</p>
<p><strong>Combat 14,9</strong><br />
  - from serial # 009.11, sail # 4765, produced in March  2011<br />
- to serial # 004.13, sail # 5377, produced in March  2013</p>
<p> According to  the Directive, the crossbeam on these gliders is to be checked and tested <strong>before the next flight</strong>!</p>
<p>For other Combat hang gliders with the round crossbeam  produced from January 2007 till December 2009 inclusive it is recommended to  have the crossbeam checked and tested during the next detailed glider check-up  according to the normal maintenance schedule.</p>
