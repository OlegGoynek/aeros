      <p>Dear  pilots. Safety is everyone’s business. We at Aeros factory recommend you to  conduct annual check up of your flying equipment. Besides the routine check please  check the following items.</p>
      <p><strong>1. </strong>Slide  the neoprene cover from the shackle of the sweep wire forward as shown on the  photo and check that the shackle of the sweep wire is bolted and safety nut is  tighten. It is important to remember that in-flight disengagement of this  attachment will cause a complete loss of structural support of the glider and  total loss of control. Please, take a look at this unit once in a while,  because it is very rear to see pilots checking it.</p>

      <p><strong>2.</strong> Open the  central zipper of the undersurface. Check the sweep wire condition along its  entire length, especially next to the nicopress sleeves  and make sure the sweep wire stays outside the  velcroed pocket ( see the report at Aeros web-page from 2008-04-11 and photo  below):</p>

      <p><strong>3.</strong> During  flight operation of the glider, especially during the rough landings the sprogs  have tendency to lower down. Check the sprogs height and make sure they are  within the safe range as given in the glider Manual.</p>
      <p align="right">We wish you  good flights and soft landings.<br />
