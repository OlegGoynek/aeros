					<p>
						Stream wing has as wide speed range, as the Stranger, note that the former's minimum speed is a bit lower (50
						km/h for a
						single-seater variant). Controllability of this wing satisfies needs of an "average" pilot. It is not as
						control
						sensitive, as the Stranger, but predictable at any speed and forgives abrupt pitch control. Roll efforts are
						normal and
						allow easy changing of bank angle from 45° to 45°. Launch is without any peculiarities — after the take-off,
						while the
						wing has not acquired trimming speed, there is some slight reverse effort on the control bar, which can be
						balanced, if
						necessary. After the take-off the wing is trimmed at cruising speed 80-85 km/h. Pitch effort at all speed
						range (from 50
						to 110 km/h) have right gradient.
					</p>
					<p>
						Stall is smooth and extended in time — first the wing "parachutes" flat, then the nose pitches downward and
						the wing
						starts acquiring speed. Reverse effort on the control bar is minor. There is no tendency to asymmetric stall.
						The wing
						is easy-controllable at coordinated control (pitch-roll). It is stable at turns neither sliding nor
						accelerating and
						easily keeps on course at turbulent flights. Stream is an ideal wing for cross country flights, the pilot does
						not tire
						even in bumpiness. Landing approach resembles that of an aircraft. Descending, Stream willingly picks up speed
						and can
						land from the ground effect mode. If desired, you can land Stream virtually from the parachuting mode, but
						vertical
						speed at touchdown will be higher. At landing the wing is stable and keeps well on course.
					</p>
					<p>
						Due to its lifting capacity and stability in air Stream is perfect for cross country flights, patrolling,
						aerophotography, for fulfilling many application tasks, including use in agriculture. The wing is suitable for
						flight
						training, as it forgives many pilot's mistakes and does not play tricks. In its training variant the wing can
						be
						furnished with control frame extension for the instructor.
