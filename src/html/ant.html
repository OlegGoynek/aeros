						In the last few years there has been growing interest in lightweight trikes. They even got their name
						'nanolight' for	being extremely light compared with conventional trikes.
					</p>
					<p>
						These little ones attract pilots for being as	portable as	possible - a nanolight trike can be folded up to fit in the back of many cars, the entire aircraft can be
						de-rigged and	stored at home with minimum time and effort.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some pilots choose nanolight trikes just to have an alternative	on normally	non-soaring days, others - to open up new soaring opportunities.
					</p>
					<p>
						The new Aeros Nanolight Trike - ANT - fully complies with the concept of maximum portability. Its main landing
						gear is	manually retractable even in flight! And of course one wouldn't need any tools to retract or extend the
						landing gear on	the ground.

					<h3>Wings for every taste</h3>
					<p>Have a look at the choice of Aeros wings for a nanolight trike:</p>
					<p>
						A Discus T has been specially designed for nanolight trikes, with a Discus hang glider used as a base. The
						Discus T
						comes in two sizes, Discus 14T and Discus 15T.
					</p>
					<p>
						Handling a Discus T in the air is as easy as handling an ordinary hangglider. With a Discus T you have the
						freedom to
						carry your own launch mechanism in the back of your car, to take off almost anywhere, to thermal and fly in
						comfort and
						silence whenever you want and to explore new locations beyond the reach of the tow or mountain launch pilots.
						Or, if you
						wish, use the engine to tour or to just get in the air.
					</p>
					<p>
						Fox T is another wing for nanolight trikes for those who want to feel the simplicity and real pleasure of
						bird-like
						flying. It is a completely different feeling when you fly the Fox T: slow, low and maneuverable flying is real
						fun! The
						Fox T has been developed from our beginner glider Fox and has been reinforced and adapted exclusively for
						flying with
						nanolight trikes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Combat T is another step higher in nanolight technology. It is designed for those who want to extend their
						abilities of
						flying faster and farther with their lightweight trikes. Besides, due to its unique design, your nanolight
						trike with a
						Combat T wing will allow you the whole aircraft storage with the wing only partially derigged and folded in
						but still
						attached to the trike, almost ready-to-go.
					</p>

					<h3>Wheels for various landing conditions</h3>
					<p>For more complex conditions of the surface on the landing place, we offer an option with the so-called big foot landing
					gear.</p>
					<img src="./img/products/ant/weels/DSC_6838.jpg" width="300px" alt="Big Foot weels">
					<h3>Rescue system</h3>
					<p>
						As an safety option Aeros offers Comelli Cylindricone rescue system. This lightweight (5.5 kg) and quite
						compact pneumatic-driven rescue system allows to safely descent up to 250 kg of payload. Release handle is connected
						to the engine's switch off circuit to avoid getting damaged from rotating blades.

						On the 23th of December 2013 load tests for T-wings (Fox 16T, Discus 15T and Combat 12T) and nano-trike ANT
						has been successfully completed.
					</p>
					<p>
						We have to note, that wasn't the first series of load tests. Wings Fox 16T and Discus 15T were successfully
						tested for the first time a few years ago. And based on the results of those tests Aeros set the maximal clip-in weight
						up to 155 kg.
					</p>
					<p>
						The main goals of the current tests are:
					</p>
					<p>
						initial testing of the Combat 12T wing
						finding ways to increase the max. clip-in weight for the wings Fox 16T and Discus 15T
						obtaining DULV's certificates for the nano-trike ANT with every model of the T-wing
						A few minor changes in a wings' design allowed us to increase max. clip-in weight to 168 kg for the Fox 16T,
						170 kg for the Discus 15T and 178 kg for the Combat 12T.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, all T-wings manufactured before the date mentioned above have to be run with max. clip-in weight not
						exceeding 155	kg. And all the new T-wings may bear load as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
					</p>
					<p>
						For owners of the "up to 155 kg" T-wings Aeros is ready to offer an upgrade kit, if needed.
					</p>
					<p>
						The nano-trike ANT has successfully passed about 20 different tests.
