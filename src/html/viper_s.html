						If you're looking for a world class competition or cross country harness, look no further. We would like to
						represent
						our new Viper-S harness which is the next level in aerodynamic performance and comfort. The Viper-S is without
						a doubt
						the lowest drag harness made by Aeros factory. The Aeros design team was able to utilize the Antonov wind
						tunnel for
						in-depth study and application of various harness drag reduction ideas. The result is a complete makeover of
						the Aeros
						racing harness design.
					</p>
					<p>
						It retains the best features of Aeros current Viper harnesses and combines them into a design that offers a
						super clean
						aerodynamic profile, reduced frontal area, and increased storage. The Aeros Viper-S will provide you with
						competitive
						performance and superior comfort, whatever the duration of your flight.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Viper — S same as previous Viper harnesses is utilize a carbon fiber backplate. This 330 mm(1.08 ft) wide,
						gently
						curving back support system allows the harness to fit as close as possible to the pilot while still allowing
						'non-binding' support. Depending on the pilot's height, the backplate is between 800 mm (2.62ft) - 1050 mm
						(3.44ft)
						long.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Viper-S has an optional Matrix cloth outer skin for drag reduction. This cloth has been proved in the wind
						tunnel to
						be the most 'slippery' available at the moment. With the Viper-S, same as with all Viper series you are able
						to replace
						the entire outer matrix cloth covering at anytime with a new one.
					</p>
					<p>
						Employing a lever system which is more reliable than those used in previous models, the Viper-S pilot is able
						to easily
						adjust the pitch (the angle of attack) of the harness in flight with his butt-without taking hands off the
						basebar.
					</p>
					<p>
						Distinctive Features:
					</p>
					<p>
						Pockets for pilot's elbows fairing;
					</p>
					<p>
						Reduced weight of the harness;
					</p>
					<p>
						Increased reliability and lifetime of the trim device;
					</p>
					<p>
						More streamlined shape of the harness's tail part;
					</p>
					<p>
						New design of the inner side pockets.
