					<p>
						The first thing that would impress you upon the arrival of your glider from the factory in a box is its
						transportation
						possibilities. The glider is very easy to break down to 3.5 meters package just by taking the outer LE off it.
						This must
						be the shortest package of a topless glider on the market. And it is light. Really light. Short pack together
						with its
						light weight (in lightest modification it is 31 kg without bags for 12.7C and 32 kg for 13.5C) makes it very
						easy to
						transport with airlines as a hand luggage without taking the glider apart or taking a sail off the glider. The
						leading
						edge consists of three tubes, this makes it really good for replacement in case of damage. For the further
						weight
						reduction Combat C has not only carbon fiber main and outer sprogs but also Dynema sprog cables. Another
						modification of
						Combat C - Combat C Swiss edition has stiff and light weight Swiss made cross beams, together with the carbon
						fiber
						light weight central unit of the cross bar. Most of these features are unique on the hang gliding market
						nowadays.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now a few words about flying characteristics. The most remarkable feature of a Combat C is its incredibly good
						climbability, it simply climbs better than the others, and it is just like a hot air balloon would bring you
						all the
						time on top of most dense gaggles. The new innovative airfoil makes a really huge improvement on climb. Such
						an airfoil
						was possible to achieve due to the elliptical shape of the carbon leading edge tubes tapered along their
						entire length
						all the way towards the end of the tubes. Now we received the profile close to that of a sailplane, which
						immediately
						showed its advantage at climb and in stall speed.Not only climb characteristics are improved with this
						profile, but even
						take off and landing became much easier.
					</p>
					<p>
						He glider is very easy to fly and effortless to control, nice coordination without even a sign of adverse yaw
						— this is
						a remarkable feature compared to our previous gliders. Light bar pressure all the way up to 80 km/h, after
						that it is
						increasing progressively.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another huge advantage is that the glider absorbs turbulence and it does not feel in the air that turbulent if
						compared
						to flying any other glider. This allows to feel the air much better and search for the lift more efficiently.
						Carbon
						elliptical leading edge tubes are less rigid vertically, that's why they damp vertical air turbulence similar
						to long
						wings of an open class sailplane.
					</p>
					<p>
						Gliding is not that much special in calm air but as soon as you get an influence from thermal activity the
						glider starts
						to glide very well, quite often arriving to the next thermal higher than most of the others.
					</p>
					<p>
						Combat C is the glider with high aspect ratio, so the horizontal stabilizer is required to fly it safely and
						efficiently. New generation of stabilizers is very light, you do not feel it in the air at all, but together
						with the
						glider's new advanced airfoil it gives a visible advantage on glide in turbulent air. This year we have made a
						stabilizer even lighter with more compact shape allowing to store it much easier.
					</p>
					<p>
						A great advantage which makes you fly really relaxed in rather nasty conditions is that you can have the
						sprogs setting
						exactly within the tolerance range of the certified configuration. There is no reason to go any lower with
						settings. The
						glider feels very nice in the air, entering and leaving thermals is very different to a tailless glider. It
						does not
						pitch up when entering a strong lift; you do not have to hold the speed bar from going forward. It is the same
						feeling
						when leaving a strong lift. The glider does not pitch down also. The whole flight is very relaxed. When pilots
						are
						talking about rough air, it is hardly possible to believe the air was rough at all, so smoothly the glider
						floats in the
						air.
					</p>
					<p>
						Even though the glider was not in a serial production for quite a long time, being under the testing and
						development,
						there is already a long list of Combat C achievements:</p>

					<h2 class="accent">Tail</h2>
					<p>
						The horizontal stabilizer (the tail) is designed to increase a hang glider pitch stability. Although it was
						designed and
						tested for Aeros hang gliders, it can be also mounted to any other hang glider as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						The tail allows flying with lower sprogs settings keeping DHV required pitch-up moment.
						The diagram below is taken from the DHV tests and shows the momentum distribution of the same glider with
						three
						different setups when driving with the test vehicle from 40 to 100 km/h. The red line shows the DHV required
						pitch. The
						blue line shows pitch for glider without the tail with sprogs set 2 deg. lower than DHV certification with VG
						on. The
						yellow line is for the same glider with the tail and VG on. The dark green line is for the same glider with
						the tail and
						VG off. For all 3 drives (glider without tail -VG 100%, glider with tail VG 100% and glider with tail VG 0%)
						the sprogs
						were set to the same level.
					</p>
					<p>
						After numerous flight tests and competition flights it was determined that the tail greatly increase not only
						the pitch
						stability but the directional stability as well. Properly adjusted hang glider with the tail retains the same
						good
						handling, but the tail adds directional stability and makes the glider pleasure to glide at higher speed in
						turbulent
						air, bringing significant gain in performance when flying in turbulent air.
					</p>
					<p>
						The difference you can see at these two tracks taken from the real track log on final glide of two gliders —
						one (lower
						one) with the tail, another one (higher one) — without.
					</p>
					<p>
						Surprisingly enough, the glider with a tail is more comfortable and easier to land than the tailless glider.
					</p>
					<p>
						The tail has symmetrical low drag profile and is rigidly mounted at 5 deg. negative angle of attack to the
						slightly
						extended keel tube. The tail consists of three parts: the center tail section and the left and the right outer
						tail
						sections. It is made of stiff light weight carbon fiber and strong enough to withstand a point loading. It can
						be easily
						stored when de-rigged and packed in a glider bag or in a harness bag.
