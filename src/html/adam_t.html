					<p>
						In the last few years there has been growing interest in lightweight trikes. They even got their name
						'nanolight' for
						being extremely light compared with conventional trikes. These little ones attract pilots for being as
						portable as
						possible - a nanolight trike can be folded up to fit in the back of many cars, the entire aircraft can be
						de-rigged and
						stored at home with minimum time and effort. Some pilots choose nanolight trikes just to have an alternative
						on normally
						non-soaring days, others - to open up new soaring opportunities.
					</p>
					<p>
						The new Aeros Nanolight Trike, ANT, fully complies with the concept of maximum portability. Its main landing
						gear is
						manually retractable even in flight! And of course one wouldn't need any tools to retract or extend the
						landing gear on
						the ground.
					</p>
					<p>
						As an safety option Aeros offers Comelli Cylindricone rescue system. This lightweight (5.5 kg) and quite
						compact
						pneumatic-driven rescue system allows to safely descent up to 250 kg of payload. Release handle is connected
						to the
						engine's switch off circuit to avoid getting damaged from rotating blades. You can find a few photos in the
						gallery
						below.
					</p>
					<p>
						With the new ANT we continue to develop our concept of offering the maximum choice that can satisfy any
						customer's needs
						and requirements. Have a look at the choice of Aeros wings for a nanolight trike:
					</p>
					<p>
						A Discus T has been specially designed for nanolight trikes, with a Discus hang glider used as a base. The
						Discus T
						comes in two sizes, Discus 14T and Discus 15T.
					</p>
					<p>
						Handling a Discus T in the air is as easy as handling an ordinary hangglider. With a Discus T you have the
						freedom to
						carry your own launch mechanism in the back of your car, to take off almost anywhere, to thermal and fly in
						comfort and
						silence whenever you want and to explore new locations beyond the reach of the tow or mountain launch pilots.
						Or, if you
						wish, use the engine to tour or to just get in the air.
					</p>
					<p>
						Fox T is another wing for nanolight trikes for those who want to feel the simplicity and real pleasure of
						bird-like
						flying. It is a completely different feeling when you fly the Fox T: slow, low and maneuverable flying is real
						fun! The
						Fox T has been developed from our beginner glider Fox and has been reinforced and adapted exclusively for
						flying with
						nanolight trikes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Combat T is another step higher in nanolight technology. It is designed for those who want to extend their
						abilities of
						flying faster and farther with their lightweight trikes. Besides, due to its unique design, your nanolight
						trike with a
						Combat T wing will allow you the whole aircraft storage with the wing only partially derigged and folded in
						but still
						attached to the trike, almost ready-to-go.
					</p>
					<p>
						Two power unit options offered for a nanolight trike also aim at satisfaction of any customer's needs. You can
						choose
						either a two-stroke JPX M25 that has an excelent price/performance ratio, or a Bailey V5 four-stroke engine
						optimal for
						minimizing further maintenance costs.
					</p>
					<p>
						As an example, an ANT trike with a Discus T wing and a Bailey V5 power unit at cruising speed consumes as
						little as 2,5
						litres of fuel per hour, offering incredible fun at minimal cost. You can power fly it for over 3 hours and
						use less
						fuel than for your drive to the tow park and a single tow with a tug!

						Certification tests.
						On the 23th of December 2013 load tests for T-wings (Fox 16T, Discus 15T and Combat 12T) and nano-trike ANT
						has been
						successfully completed.
	
						We have to note, that wasn't the first series of load tests. Wings Fox 16T and Discus 15T were successfully
						tested for
						the first time a few years ago. And based on the results of those tests Aeros set the maximal clip-in weight
						up to 155
						kg.
	
						The main goals of the current tests are:
	
						initial testing of the Combat 12T wing
						finding ways to increase the max. clip-in weight for the wings Fox 16T and Discus 15T
						obtaining DULV's certificates for the nano-trike ANT with every model of the T-wing
						A few minor changes in a wings' design allowed us to increase max. clip-in weight to 168 kg for the Fox 16T,
						170 kg for
						the Discus 15T and 178 kg for the Combat 12T.
	
						So, all T-wings manufactured before the date mentioned above have to be run with max. clip-in weight not
						exceeding 155
						kg. And all the new T-wings may bear load as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
	
						For owners of the "up to 155 kg" T-wings Aeros is ready to offer an upgrade kit, if needed.
	
						The nano-trike ANT has successfully passed about 20 different tests.
	
						Below you can see a few shots that were taken during the test procedures.
