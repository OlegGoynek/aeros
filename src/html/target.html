					<p>
						In the former USSR this glider has initially been introduced as a "Student". A number of first gliders had
						this plain
						name written on their keel pockets. Besides, hang gliders with the same parameters and name were manufactured
						in a MAI
						hang gliding club. A name so dear to our heart and ears did not fit in the West, and following the advice of
						our British
						distributor, there appeared the name Target. Target is not just a BUTT or an OBJECTIVE which is to be hit with
						any kind
						of weapon, this is also a MISSION, i.e. a goal in life to be pursued by everyone who has chosen a hang glider
						as a
						transport for travelling in the "fifth ocean".
					</p>
					<p>
						Targets are beginner-friendly, forgive blunders, are absolutely not tiresome during turbulent flights and long
						soaring
						flights. Starting is as easy as you can only imagine! Smooth proportionate control pull allows to acquire
						proper
						experience for switching to more masterly sport wings. Targets are obedient and controllable at landing.
					</p>
					<p>
						Do you need "a school desk" which will teach flying several dozens of disciples and will not make you go bust
						buying
						spare parts? Hang gliders of Target family have been designed taking into consideration all usual requirements
						of flight
						school instructors to training devices. They are trouble-free, easy to repair, rigid construction stands hard
						landing
						which is unavoidable in the process of training. Agreeable prices for spare parts!
					</p>
					<p>
						Do you wish to expand a range of paragliding? Speed and manoeuvrability of a paraglider, reliability, ability
						to fly
						with high wind, when your colleagues fold their canopies â€” hang gliders of Target series let every skyfloater
						enjoy
						soaring. Target is very easily controlled on the run and allows to climb in thermic without any problem. It
						will take
						you not more than 10 minutes to assemble your hang glider out of a 6-meter package.
					</p>
					<p>
						Would you like to watch a new spot from a bird's flight height? All Target family members are the best choice
						for pilots
						preferring to fly in various, sometimes even exotic places. Hang gliders are dismounted into 2-meter packages
						that are
						easy to place into a baggage hold of any plane, bus, train, elevator cabin. It will take you not more than
						half an hour
						to prepare your hang glider for flight and start a breathtaking air travel.
					</p>
					<p>
						Isn't it high time to stretch old bones? You started to fly 20 years ago, but either living circumstances or
						personal
						preferences prevented you from becoming a tough sportsman. But you still long for flying over a hillside,
						don't you?
						Target hang gliders will once again let you feel cloudless joy of free flight, not risking to break your neck
						while
						landing.
					</p>
					<p>
						Do you live in a flatland area or would you like to be independent of the weather's whims? In spite of this,
						would you
						like to experience the joy of soaring? An obvious solution is to install a small and light engine on your
						wing, which
						will allow you to perform foot launch, to gain altitude easily and to land safely like on a usual hang glider.
						The
						Target 13M/16M version is specially modified for this purpose: the glider's frame is strengthened, there is an
						extra
						keel tube in-cut not to interfere with powerplant and propeller installing.
						Doodlebug and Mosquito powered harnesses owners' reports on this wing modification are very positive.
					</p>
					<p>
						New Target 21 tandem hang glider launches, handles and lands quite similarly to Target 16. The glider is
						comfortable at
						all flight modes from the first steps at launch to the very landing. Despite its large size, the glider can be
						easily
						flown by a single pilot unless his weight is under 85 kg.
					</p>
					<p>
						Warning!
					</p>
					<p>
						Flying a tandem glider requires pilot's stable attainments, which are normally acquired gradually. That is why
						it is
						recommended to start tandem flying with a hang glider pilot as a passenger to make sure he will act adequately
						at launch	and at landing.
					</p>
					<p>
						Preflight instruction on the aircraft crew actions at launch, in the air and at landing is absolutely
						necessary!
					</p>
					<p>
						It is imperative to have wheels on the control bar!
